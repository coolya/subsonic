  require any disk usage.<p/> \
  <p>The actual transcoding is done by third-party command line programs which must be installed in {0} (or in a directory present in the PATH \
  environment variable). A transcoding pack for Windows \
  is available <a target="_blank" href="http://subsonic.sourceforge.net/transcode.html">here</a>. You can add your own custom transcoder given that it \
  fulfills the following requirements: \
  <ul> \
  <li>It must have a command line interface.</li> \
  <li>It must be able to send output to stdout.</li> \
  <li>If used in step 2 or 3, it must be able to read input from stdin. (In step 1, use "%s" to refer to the input file).</li> \
  </ul> \
