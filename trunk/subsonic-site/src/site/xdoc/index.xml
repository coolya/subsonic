                Subsonic is a free, web-based media streamer, providing access to your entire music collection wherever you are.
                Use it to share your music with friends, or to listen to your own music while at work.  You can
                stream to multiple players simultaneously, for instance to one player in your kitchen and another in your
                living room.
            </p>

            <p>
                Subsonic is designed to handle very large music collections (many thousand albums). It uses a combination
                of directory structure and tag parsing to organize the music. Although optimized for MP3 streaming, it works for
                any audio or video format that can stream over HTTP (for instance AAC and OGG). By using transcoder plug-ins, Subsonic
                supports on-the-fly conversion and streaming of virtually any audio format, including WMA, FLAC, APE, Musepack, WavPack,
                Shorten and OptimFROG.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have constrained bandwidth, you may set an upper limit for the bitrate of the music streams. Subsonic will
                then automatically resample the music to a suitable bitrate. (Supported for MP3 only).
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to being a streaming media server, Subsonic works very well as a local jukebox.  The intuitive web
                interface, as well as search and index facilities, are optimized for efficient browsing through large media
                libraries.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Subsonic works with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Mac and Solaris.
                    The Subsonic server requires
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">Java 5.0</a> and a JSP container such
                    as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>, both of which are available at no charge.

                    To receive streams you need a web browser (tested on recent versions of Firefox, Opera and IE) and a media
                    player (Winamp, Windows Media Player etc). Refer to the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for a list of recommended players.

                <p>
                    I'm looking for volunteers who'd like to translate Subsonic to new languages. Interested?
                    Please read <a href="translate.html">this</a>. I'm also looking for someone to improve the Subsonic logo -
                    I like the concept of a yellow submarine, but would like the logo to have a more contemporary and professional look.
                    Please contact me if you would like to help.
