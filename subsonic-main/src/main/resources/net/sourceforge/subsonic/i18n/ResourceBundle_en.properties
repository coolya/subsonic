                           For instance, if your original mp3 files are encoded using 256 Kbps (kilobits per second), setting max bitrate \
                           to 128 will make Subsonic automatically resample the music from 256 to 128 Kbps.</p> \
                           <p>This option requires that LAME is installed.  LAME <a target="_blank" href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">(http://lame.sourceforge.net)</a> \
                           is an open source mp3 encoder. You can <a target="_blank" href="http://mitiok.cjb.net/">download it here</a>. Please make sure that the directory \
                           in which you install LAME is present in the PATH variable.</p> \
                           <p>Currently, resampling music to lower bitrates is only supported for mp3 files using constant bitrate encoding. \
                           (This is, however, the most common encoding).</p>

                       <p>The specification is a space-separated list of index entries. Normally, each entry is just a single character, \
                       but you may also specify multiple characters.  For instance, the entry <em>The</em> will link to all files and  \
                       folders starting with "The".</p> \
                       <p>You may also create an entry using a group of index characters in paranthesis. For instance, the entry \
                       <em>A-E(ABCDE)</em> will display as <em>A-E</em> and link to all files and folders starting with either \
                       A, B, C, D or E.  This may be useful for grouping less-frequently used characters (such and X, Y and Z), or \
                       for grouping accented characters (such as A, \u00c0 and \u00c1)</p> \
                       <p>Files and folders that are not covered by an index entry will be placed under the index entry "#".</p>
