                Subsonic is a free, web-based media streamer, providing access to your entire music collection wherever
                you are. Use it to share your music with friends, or to listen to your own music while at work. You can
                stream to multiple players simultaneously, for instance to one player in your kitchen and another in
                your living room.
            </p>

            <p>
                Subsonic is designed to handle very large music collections (many thousand albums). It uses a
                combination of directory structure and tag parsing to organize the music. Although optimized for MP3 streaming, it
                works for any audio or video format that can stream over HTTP (for instance AAC and OGG). By using transcoder
                plug-ins, Subsonic supports on-the-fly conversion and streaming of virtually any audio format, including WMA, FLAC, APE,
                Musepack, WavPack, Shorten and OptimFROG.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have constrained bandwidth, you may set an upper limit for the bitrate of the music streams.
                Subsonic will then automatically resample the music to a suitable bitrate.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to being a streaming media server, Subsonic works very well as a local jukebox. The
                intuitive web interface, as well as search and index facilities, are optimized for efficient browsing through large
                media libraries.
            </p>

                    Subsonic works with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Mac and Solaris.
                    The Subsonic server requires <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">Java 5.0</a>
                    and a JSP container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>, both of which are available at no charge.
                    To receive streams you need a web browser (tested on recent versions of Firefox, Opera and IE) and a
                    media player (Winamp, Windows Media Player etc). Refer to the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>
                    for a list of recommended players.
