                <p><ol>

                    <li>Install Java from <a href="http://www.java.com/">http://www.java.com/</a>.</li>

                    <li>Install Tomcat from <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">http://tomcat.apache.org/</a>. Note that version 5.5 or
                        later is required.</li>

                    <li>Stop Tomcat if it's running.</li>

                    <li>Copy the file <em>subsonic.war</em> to <em>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/webapps</em>.</li>

                    <li>Start Tomcat.</li>

                    <li>Point your web browser to http://localhost/subsonic (or http://localhost:8080/subsonic if you
                        installed Tomcat on port 8080.)</li>

                    <li>Logon with username <em>admin</em> and password <em>admin</em>. You should change the password immediately.
                        Click <em>Settings</em> to change password and create new users.
                    </li>

                    <li>Subsonic will attempt to create the directory c:\subsonic (on Windows) or /var/subsonic (all other
                        platforms). This will fail if the user running Tomcat doesn't have the necessary privileges. In that case, create
                        the directory manually, and make sure that Tomcat has write access to it.

                <p><ol>

                    <li>Stop Tomcat.</li>

                    <li>Remove both <em>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/webapps/subsonic.war</em> and the
                        <em>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/webapps/subsonic</em> directory.</li>

                    <li>If upgrading from version 2.4 (or earlier) to 2.5 (or later) - Please follow steps 6 and 7 above.</li>

                    <li>If the upgrade does not seem to have any effect, delete all files in the
                        <em>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/work</em> directory.</li>

            <subsection name="Notes">
                <p><ul>

                    <li>If you installed Tomcat as a Windows Service, you can start and stop it from the service manager
                        (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services) </li>

                    <li><em>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;</em> refers to the directory in which you installed Tomcat, typically
                        <em>C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5</em></li>

                    <li>In Subsonic 2.5 and later, users are no longer configured in <em>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/conf/tomcat-users.xml</em>.
                        Users are now created and configured on the <em>Settings</em> page.</li>

                </ul></p>

                        <li>Upgrade to the latest Tomcat version (at least if you're using Tomcat 5.0 or earlier).</li>
                        <li>Look for errors in the Subsonic log (c:\subsonic\subsonic.log or /var/subsonic/subsonic.log).</li>
                        <li>Look for errors in the Tomcat logs (&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/logs).</li>
                        <li>Post a message to the <a href="forum.html">Subsonic forum</a>. Please let us know what Subsonic version,
                            Tomcat version and operating system you're using. Also, please give a detailed description of the problem.
                            This way, we'll be able to help you faster.</li>
